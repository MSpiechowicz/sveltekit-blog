Hello everyone!
<br/>

I'm happy to announce that the public repository of my blog is now available on GitHub.
<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ You can find it [here](https://github.com/MSpiechowicz/sveltekit-blog).

## Feedback

Feel free to check it out, fork it, and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm always open to feedback. I hope you'll find it useful.

## Ideas

I still have a lot of ideas for improvements and new features, so stay tuned for more updates. For example, I want to move some of the business logic into the JSON/env file, so that it is easier to replace the graphic, move the website skeleton, etc. without the necessity to touch the code itself.
<br/>

There is also some more cleaning up to do, so please be patient with me.
<br/>

Greetings,

Maciej
