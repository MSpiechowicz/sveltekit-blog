Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

Guess what? I have a new project for you! It's called **The Flow of Time** and it allows you to check how much time you have left in your life. It is a simple web application that calculates the remaining time based on your life expectancy and the current date. The project is built with Vite, Svelte 5, and TypeScript.

<br/>

If someone is bothering you with the meetings or other time-consuming activities, you can use this tool to show them how much time you are wasting. It is a simple and effective way to visualize the flow of time and how precious it is.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ Check it out [here](https://mspiechowicz.github.io/flowoftime)!

<br/>

That is it for now. Stay healthy and keep coding!

<br/>

Greetings,

Maciej
