Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

It is almost the end of the year, so I decided to create a simple business card website built with React. I wanted to update my wife's website and decided to go with something simple, yet elegant. I hope you'll like it.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ You can find it [here](https://github.com/MSpiechowicz/business-card-style-website).

<br/>

The goal was to provide the possibility for the non-technical user to easily update the content of the website. This part was achieved by moving the configuration part into the **env** file. On top of that I added the possibility to change the version of the business card by changing one of the variables.

<br/>

Although it is not a big feature, it is a nice touch. For now, only one version is supported but I want to add at least two more in the upcoming month.

## How to install it?

You can clone the repository, install the dependencies, modify the **env** file and run the project. Everything is documented inside the **README** file. It can be hosted via Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or other hosting services (depending on your preferences).

<br/>

I wish you all Happy New Year and a lot of success in the upcoming year. Stay healthy and keep coding!

<br/>

Greetings,

Maciej
