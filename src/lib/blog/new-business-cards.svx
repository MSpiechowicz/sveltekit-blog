Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

It's the final countdown to the New Year! ðŸŽ‰ I wanted to finish this 2024 with additional commits to the Business Card project. I was able to add two new versions that you can use. The inspiration came from browsing the internet and articles related to the topic ðŸ˜Š.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ You can find it [here](https://github.com/MSpiechowicz/business-card-style-website).

<br/>

Once again, I wish you all Happy New Year and a lot of success in the upcoming year. Stay healthy and keep coding!

<br/>

Greetings,

Maciej
