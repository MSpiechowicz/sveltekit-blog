Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

Today I would like to share with you some of the useful snippets that I use in my daily work.
The snippets are divided into categories, so you can easily find what you are looking for. For now
it does contain only bash scripts, but I have a plan to later add more content.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ You can find it [here](https://github.com/MSpiechowicz/useful-snippets).

## What you can find there?

- â˜ž  function to count the words inside the JSON file
- â˜ž  function to count the words inside all the JSON files at the provided directory
- â˜ž  function to count the words inside the PDF file
- â˜ž  function to count the words inside all the PDF files at the provided directory
- â˜ž  function to kill the process based on the TCP port
- â˜ž  function to clear all of the local branches with the exception of the main, master, prod or dev
  branches

## How to install it?

Just copy the sh files to your project and use them as you wish. You can also add them to your
`.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to have them available globally.
<br/>

Greetings,

Maciej
