Yet another day when I have something for you ðŸ¥³.
<br/>

I decided to do push myself into the NeoVim world yet again. Since two days I am playing with the
configuration to set up everything according to my needs. Most of the time this means copy/paste
some of the useful libraries/settings from the Visual Studio Code, which I was using almost every
single day.
<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ You can find it [here](https://github.com/MSpiechowicz/lazyvim-config).

## What you can find there?

- â˜ž  pretty and readable colorscheme
- â˜ž  performance fix and improvements
- â˜ž  some useful keybindings
- â˜ž  Copilot integration
- â˜ž  Copilot Chat integration
- â˜ž  frontend development support
- â˜ž  code formatting support
- â˜ž  eslint support
- â˜ž  git support
- â˜ž  and many more!

## How to install it?

You can check the installation guide in the Readme file in the repository. It is rather
straightforward.

## Updates?

I will try to keep it up to date with the latest plugins and settings. If you have any suggestions
or ideas, feel free to create an issue or PR. I am open to any feedback.
<br/>

Greetings,

Maciej
